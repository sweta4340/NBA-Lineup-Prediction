# NBA-Lineup-Prediction
Predicting a team's lineup is crucial for determining the match outcome in sports.

Problem Statements:
1) When provided with five home team players' names and five away team players' names, predict the game's outcome.
2) When four away team players and five home team players are given, predict the fifth player in the lineup and the fifth player in the lineup to enhance the likelihood of the away team winning.

This paper focuses on using:
Feature Selection, 
Feature Transformation,
Classification Models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks and Random Forest),
Embeddings to solve the problem statement. 

Result: The best model for solving this problem is Random Forest, which gave an accuracy of 79%.
