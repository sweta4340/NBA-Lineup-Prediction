# NBA-Lineup-Prediction
In sports, predicting a team's lineup is crucial for determining the match outcome. Through trial and error and Feature Selection, Feature Transformation, Classification Models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks and Random Forest), and Embeddings for text data. TA 79% accuracy using Random Forest was observed. The Problem Statements addressed in this paper would be:
